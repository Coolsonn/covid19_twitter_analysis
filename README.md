# covid19_twitter_analysis

This is Python project regarding fake tweets detection. It consists of two separate parts: detecting if tweets is fake or real and analyzing the sentiment.

Both parts have similar steps accomplished. We started from finding right datasets with correct labels. Than we conducted small analysis of them like distribution of labels. After that we performed preprocessing, it consisted of: deleting excessive parts of tweets, adjusting some text, correcting grammar and lastly encoding, tokenization and padding. Than we created models to learn from data.

Last part was creating a simple GUI which presents our results.

During this projects we used multiple tools and libraries like: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, keras, language_tool_python or kivy.
